# DataStructures
This repo contains several common data structures, made using Java, during my enrollment in Northeastern's [CS 2510 Accelerated](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510a) course. They were created using guidance from the homeworks, labs, lectures, and exams created by my professor, [Benjamin Lerner](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/benjamin-lerner/).

## What is tester.jar?
I use Ben Lerner's tester library (contained in tester.jar) to test my code! To use it, include it in whatever project contains these .java files as an external jar and set your run configurations to use tester.Main as the main class, with the name of the Examples___ class as the program argument.
